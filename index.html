                M&M's are colorful button-shaped chocolates produced by Mars, Incorporated. The candy shell, each of which has the letter "m" printed in lower case on one side, surrounds a filling which varies depending upon the variety of M&M's. M&M's are available in various colors and flavors, making them a popular choice among candy lovers of all ages.

            <p>
                The history of M&M's dates back to 1941 when Forrest Mars Sr., the son of the founder of the Mars Company, struck a partnership with Bruce Murrie, the son of the Hershey Chocolate president. The two combined their resources to produce the beloved candy that has since become a household name.

                M&M's are not just a tasty treat; they have also become an iconic brand known for its clever advertising campaigns and memorable characters, such as the spokescandies Red, Yellow, Blue, and Green. These characters have been featured in commercials, print ads, and even animated series, further cementing the brand's popularity and recognition worldwide.
